* Common man (page 35/24) - Are there any advantages/disadvantages or are they just super basic with no mods?
* Combat Mage 2 - The Body points almost have to be wrong
* Do we need pictures in Wall Spells and Concentration Rules section?

* I probably need to add the differetn verbals for each rank of spells
* Need to go back through spells and mark individually which ones are lost magic since not all spells of a given rank are in lost magic

* Up to page 69 or so it's probably been about 15 hours of transcribing

* Need to have someone read over spell names, costs, durations, and ranks to double check
