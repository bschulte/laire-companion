* Common man (page 35/24) - Are there any advantages/disadvantages or are they just super basic with no mods?
* Combat Mage 2 - The Body points almost have to be wrong
* Do we need pictures in Wall Spells and Concentration Rules section?

* I probably need to add the differetn verbals for each rank of spells
* Need to go back through spells and mark individually which ones are lost magic since not all spells of a given rank are in lost magic

* Up to page 69 or so it's probably been about 15 hours of transcribing

* Need to have someone read over spell names, costs, durations, and ranks to double check

* The copy and pasted double quote character probably needs to be replaced and swapped with escaped quotes

* Are any of the italicized or bolded text things that actually matter to the rule?

* For the golem creation table, there doesn't appear to be the first footer for the table
* A lot of potions have "Instant" duration, but then in the description say they last for the duration of the potion
* The Combat rules section (Chapter 6) seems to have some duplicate rules, probably should consolidate or reorganize better (looks to be the same for Death and Dying)
* Do we need the resurrection stories? I only included the 1st one
* I didn't include the weapon building rules
