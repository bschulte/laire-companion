    "introduction": [
      "An Alchemist is an individual devoted to understanding and unlocking the secrets of nature and using them to create rare and exotic substances. In addition to a devotion to studying all the available alchemical literature, the basis of the Alchemist consists of tradesman skills, such as refining, distilling, and preparing dissected parts into alchemical components. As the Alchemist advances they learn to combine these trades with their knowledge of the arcane and science to create standard alchemical items from known recipes. Once an Alchemist has advanced well into their career the famous alchemical skills become available, such as the creation of golems. At the apex of their career, after many years of hard work and study the alchemist may be able to achieve rank 5 of their chosen specialty and there by perform research and design their own alchemical items.",
      "It is truly the rare and almost unheard of alchemist who has achieved rank 6 in any one school of alchemy."

        "content": "Using Alchemical Items"
      },
      "Some alchemical items are easily used by anyone, while others require the wielder to be instructed. Any character can use any Potion, Solution, or Poison, so long as it is used in the correct manner. If the character, for example drinks an Oil of Sharpeness they would gain no benefit and would get an upset stomach instead; or if a character used a Healing Potion on a sword the potion would have no effect.",
      "A character cannot be forced to drink an alchemical item if they are unwilling. They can be charmed or coerced into drinking something however. Characters who are Unconscious, Bleeding to Death, Mortally Wounded or Dying cannot drink alchemical items. Golems and non-corporeal undead cannot drink alchemical items either.",
      "Although some alchemical items duplicate magical spell effects, these items are not magical themselves. Therefore, detection spells do not detect alchemical items as magical",
      "Defenses that stop spells such as a Defense, Negation, Reflection, Absorption, and Resist Suggestion spells are ineffective against alchemical items. The Purity spell and Ritual of Alchemy Shield will stop most alchemy. These magical defenses and the Resist Alchemy and Nature’s Purity skills will not stop alchemical items that produce an effect and therefore do not affect the character directly. The following alchemical items are stopped by magical defenses that stop physical attacks: Paste of Binding, Acids, Fire Breath Potion, Sun Water, Paste of Stickiness, and Alchemical Lubricant. Additionally, alchemical items like Oil of Striking, Oil of Mithril Blade, Oil of Fire Blade, and Oil of Armor affect the weapon or armor and are not stopped by these defenses. The Purity spell will not stop any ingested alchemical item. Gases and dusts are not stopped by defensive martial skills, if a character chooses to use one they take the affect of the alchemical item.",
      "A Purify Blood spell cures or removes all alchemical effects that do not cause damage that affect the character directly. For example, the effects of a Sleep Poison, Paralysis Poison, Silence Poison, Giant Strength Potion, etc. will end if the character is affected by a Purify Blood spell.",
      "An alchemical item that is thrown like a dust, contact item or gas is used as soon as it is thrown, no matter where it lands or if a character catches the packet. The player must tear about half the tag off the physical representation before throwing the item. A character cannot “prepare” more than one alchemical item ahead of time before throwing them and the character has 1 minute to use the item before it becomes inert. Thrown contact poisons, in order to take affect, must hit a character with no physical Armor Points remaining. Alchemical items in a pouch or pocket are not broken if struck with a weapon. As a general rule, if you find any thrown alchemy on the ground during a big battle, you should assume it is used. This is also true for contact substances that are placed on a weapon or object. If the sword hits the player – not their weapon or shield – the alchemical item is used. If a defense that stops physical attacks is called against the alchemical item, the item is also used. Once any alchemy – thrown or applied – is used it cannot be reused or collected.",
      "If a weapon or object coated with a poison is touched by bare skin, the poison is expended and the character is affected. If a character is immune to a poison, they cannot apply that poison to their bare hand. While they will not be affected by the poison, it is still expended.",
      "It is possible to stack a spell and an alchemical item at the same time. As a rule, only one type of alchemical item can be drunk or used at one time. The same is true for alchemical items on objects. In other words, only one Giant Strength potion can be used at one time, or one Oil of Striking. You can use two oils on a weapon so long as they are of different types. If you do mix two like items, both will be destroyed.",
      "For example, Duncan uses an Oil of Striking +2 and an Oil of Silver Blade on his weapon. Now the weapon will swing for a base of 4 points of damage and with the “Silver” suffix, so “8 Silver” with all of his other bonuses. But if Duncan adds another Oil of Striking – of any strength – all oils of striking are destroyed or an Oil of Mithril Blade or Ghost Blade then all the blade oils are destroyed.",
      "Alchemical items on an item are used as soon as the item is used. If a person dies and must go to the Healers’ Guild, without their body, all alchemical effects are gone. If an item is shattered or destroyed, all alchemical items on it are destroyed as well. All alchemical items take effect instantly after being administered, unless noted elsewhere.",
      {
        "type": "header",
        "content": "Special Rule of Poisons"
      },
      "A poison or other alchemical item that is an ingested substance can be placed in food or drink. Most of the food or drink must be consumed before the item will take effect, for marshaling purposes at least 75% of the food or drink counts as most.",
      "If a character wants to poison a large container or vessel, such as a cask of ale or a pot of stew, they need to have enough doses of the alchemical substance to dose the entire batch or container.",
      "For example, Balthazar decides he wants to “spice” things up at the feast one night. He goes to a Marshal and asks how many servings of stew are in the pot in the kitchen. The Marshall rules that the pot holds 25 servings of stew. Balthazar would then need 25 Gypsy Love Poisons to dose the batch, any less and the attempt completely fails and all doses are lost. But Balthazar has been planning this for a long time and has the needed 25 doses of the poison. He sneaks in the kitchen and while Fugazi the Cook is not looking, dumps the poison into the pot, while the Marshal is watching. Now whenever someone finishes their stew they will fall in love with the next person of the opposite sex they see.",
      "Even though there is a potential for a lot of an alchemical item needed for a container, unless a character has the first rank of the appropriate school, the alchemical item is undetectable.",
      {
        "type": "header",
        "content": "Material Components"
      },
      "Alchemical items are produced by following a prescribed recipe. This involves physically and chemically transforming the material components into the desired product by sheer force of will. There are two types of components: common ones, called Reagents, and Rare Components. Reagents are simple, common chemicals and herbs that are used in brewing the item. They are found all over Midlantia: from the Elven forest to the Dwarven mines, from the ocean to the Northern Ice. None of these are difficult to get, nor do they require special skills to collect, but require some one willing to get them, like merchants. The Reagents can be purchased, typically for 5 copper pieces each, from the Alchemist Guild, found while adventuring, or at the Merchants Guild. The second component type, the Rare Component, must be acquired in game.",
      "In order to properly collect material components, the player must have Dissection for characters, Herbal Lore for plants, and anyone can collect minerals once identified. When gathering material components, a player should write down the nature of the component and have an appropriate witness sign their name and player number. It should then be taken to an Alchemy Marshal or the Treasure Marshal, where a tag will be generated. In game, the Alchemist actually sits down after dissecting and refines, to a certain degree, the component to get from it all he needs to make it useful. For example the Alchemist needs the blood of a Troll. All the blood in the Troll is bled out and the final drops are collected and brought back to the guild. There the Alchemist refines it down to a few useful doses. A player can increase the usefulness of these Rare Components with the Advanced Refining skill.",
      "A character may never substitute one component for another. If the recipe calls for the Willing Blood of a Paladin, only the Willing Blood of a Paladin may be used. Even if that blood comes from a human, a Solar or a Dragon, it is the same component. If a character wishes to use a different component in a recipe, they must research a new version of that alchemical item. Players should read the section on creating new alchemy for further information.",
      "Some characters, especially monster types, might be worth more doses of a component being dissected. For example, the character is looking for Essence of a Memory Moss and discovers a creature called the Mother of all Memory Mosses. Instead of the two doses the character would normally get, they will receive four doses from dissecting the character. The Plot Committee will indicate on any special character if they yield more than the normal number of doses, the player does not need to ask. If the NPC’s card does not say it gives more doses, then it does not.",
      {
        "type": "header",
        "content": "Alchemical Tags"
      },
      "Alchemical items can only be identified by characters with the appropriate Alchemy skill. Therefore, a character who acquires alchemical items will not know what the item is until it is properly identified. This does not preclude anyone from labeling the item in- game either correctly or incorrectly but the number, and/or description on the LAIRE item tag must be present, correct and whole. An out-of-game tag will be placed on the physical representation for each item. This tag should have the code number for the item; this allows characters with the appropriate skills to identify the item. The character identifying an item should initial the out-of-game tag as proof of a character’s in-game knowledge of the item’s identity with their initials and player number.",
      "All finished products must be in a vial. A player cannot have their character carry a stack of finished items while they adventure. It is acceptable to have just tags and no vials when a character has their items in its place of storage.",
      "For example, Pyrrhus has several poisons and potions in his in-game box in his room at the event. He keeps them on a tag ring, not in vials. He decides he wants to sell some about town and use a few others on an adventure. He must place all the tags he is taking from his room into vials; he cannot simply take the tags and carry them on his tag ring.",

The character is limited to the amount of alchemy they can create in one month’s time. The rate of production, in-game production time, and cost is given in the table below.",
      "An Alchemist receives 5 Production Points per Rank of skill that they know, per school that they know. So a character with Rank 2 Potions will have 10 Production Points for potion creation only and a character with Rank 5 Solutions would have 25 Production Points of solution creation only. The Alchemist gets to renew their Production Points on the first day of the month, regardless of when the LAIRE Event takes place. The character gets their production for each school of Alchemy they know. However, the earned Production Points for each school are not transferable between schools; a player cannot use their Poison Production Points to make Solutions. The points may only be combined when making a Golem. Each alchemical item must be made separately and cannot be created in “batches”. The alchemist does not have to work on their items consecutively, but must complete the item once started. Brewing alchemical items does not require the characters complete concentration. Therefore, they are able to converse, cast spells, etc, however if they are attacked or forced to walk away from their work their brewing automatically fails and all Reagents and Rare Components are lost.",
      "For example, Terrance with Rank II Solutions, Rank IV Poisons and Rank V Potions has 10 Production Points towards Solutions, 20 Production Points towards Poisons and 25 Production Points towards Poisons. He cannot use his Potion Production Points to make a Solution or Poison.",

Siona tells the marshal he is finished and they calculate the roll needed to succeed. -12% for the Power Point Penalty, +8% for knowledge of the Healing School, +0% for time taken - Siona needs to have taken 24 minutes to gain the bonus, +5% for using vellum paper, and finally +2% for good roleplaying during the scribing of the scroll. That gives Lisa Tomaszewski a total of +3%, which means the player must roll a 13 or higher to succeed.",

So, a long sword with an embedded Fireball spell would do 16 points of magic fire and 2 points of damage. Castable means that the spell can be thrown normally but cannot be touch cast from the item.",

Had Thomas made the item Castable, he would not be able to strike his opponents with the sword, but could throw the Fireballs from the item.",

      "Spell Singing is an arcane mystical art. It draws its power from the tension between Law and Chaos – the constant pull and opposition of these two universal forces and the universal harmony created by this dance of the universe. While not exactly a high magic in the way Sorcery and Warlockery are - for it does not draw its power from the same source as low magic - it still requires its practitioners to understand arcane concepts necessary to wield this magic. The power behind Spell Singing is magic, but not from the same source that other arcane casters draw upon.",
      "The Spell Singers themselves are creatures of balance. They must maintain an inner balance between the universal and divine powers of the universe. This prevents them from “picking a side” and therefore cannot become – and subsequently, cannot learn skills from – Followers of the Light, Druids, Servants of Darkness, Sorcerers or Warlocks. They can live their lives as lawfully or chaotically, good or wickedly as they wish so long as they do not pledge their lives to these sides and do not learn any of the skills off these Advanced Career skill lists.",
      "In times past, the Spell Singer has been the messenger of the Lorelei, their voice amongst the mortal races; fulfilling their masters desire to maintain the balance between good and evil in their eternal struggle against one another. The Lorelei have lost their hold over this magic and it is now up to mortals alone to govern its use and teaching."

A Spell Singer can teach and share another Spell Singer one of their individualized songs from their song book. The character does not need the Teach skill and needs to sign the Spell Singer’s song book to verify they have taught them the song. If the player wants to create an individualized song for their character, they need to work with a Spell Singer teacher, and have their new song approved by the teacher and a Magic Marshal.",

The song should be descriptive of its effects and players hearing the song should be readily able to know what the song does. These songs must be approved by Magic Marshal before they are used.

The player may stop singing to call out-of-game effects or invoke spells, call martial defenses, or use abilities that do not require an in-game verbal. However, the Spell Singer must sing enough of their song so it is clear to everyone they are still singing a song.",

If a character is running past some trees while the song is sung, they are still affected by the spell, but should the character run behind a building, out of sight, or behind some semi-transparent obstacle, the song fails and the Spell Singing Points are still expended.",
      "The target player must be able to hear the song, if the character is deaf – either naturally or because they have caused themselves to be deaf – the song still takes effect. Deafness is not a defense. If the player fails to hear the song because their attention is otherwise occupied elsewhere they are still affected by the song, however, if the player is far enough away or the Spell Singer not loud enough to reach the player the song fails. As a general rule, if there is someone else near the target that heard the song, the spell will take affect.",

    "introduction": [
      "The Warlock is the quintessential battle mage. Through a complex ceremony, a Warlock becomes attuned to the power of magic, which allows them to alter the very fabric of magic itself. A Warlock is a practitioner of high magic; trained to use low magic to its fullest potential. Warlocks use the power of magic in a chaotic manner; they are not wielders of chaos. It is in how they use their low magic, in a personal and individual way that denotes their alleged tie to chaos.",
      "On the battlefield, a Warlock’s magic is seldom matched, and rarely defeated. Off the battlefield, the Warlock’s skills and knowledge are valuable and coveted. Some Warlocks believe all this power comes with a price…",
      "A proficient Warlock is able to augment low magic in order to increase its effectiveness. Some of the more popular feats of a Warlock involve punching through any low magic spell defense, casting a spell without reciting a verbal, doubling the damage or duration of spells, and casting a spell at a target without throwing a spell packet.",
      "The Warlocks in Avalon have formed themselves into a tight group called the Warlock Circle harking back to the old days when all Warlocks were part of a circle. However, not all Warlocks are members of this circle and some “rogue” Warlocks practice their art outside the domain of the Circle.",
      "While the Avaolnian Warlock Circle professes to be good and are supposedly dedicated to the protection of Avalon, rumors persist of a dark conspiracy tied to the Warlock's sinister history. It is also spoken of in the quiet voices of the existence of an evil Circle of Warlocks that serve their old masters still.",
      "The Avalonian Warlock Circle conducts an initiation ceremony to their circle called the Awakening Ceremony. What goes on during this ceremony is a secret that a character must learn about in-game."

    "rules": [
      "Use of a Warlock skill does not change the Power Point cost of a spell. For the skill Double Power, the character pays the normal Power Point cost. For the skill Double Cast, the character pays the Power point cost of both spells.",
      "Warlock skills can be combined together. The prefix associated with each skill must be included in the spell verbal, but the order in which they are used does not matter, for example: “With Total Power, Double Power, Double Cast Dragon’s Breath Spell”. The one exception to this is the Total Power and Perfect Aim skills, which can never be combined with the exception of special cases, such as higher beings and characters with Plot approved perks.",
      "Sometimes Warlock skills are not lost if they do not take affect. The Spell Binding, Double Cast, Double Power, Overlay, Perfect Aim, and Total Power skills are not used if you err in their verbal, take damage or miss the target, but the Power Points are still lost. If the attack is stopped by a defense that stops spells, the skills are used and the Recover Power skill cannot be used. Recover Power, Speed Cast, and Spell Holding are used as soon as they are invoked, so if the character errs in their verbal, takes damage or misses the target, these skills are lost.",
      "The eyes of the Warlock will glow with the color of the type of magic being used whenever the Warlock uses a Warlock skill. If a Warlock casts a latent spell, then the eyes of the target will glow when the latent spell is invoked.",
      "Only spells cast by the character can be augmented with their warlock skills. Spells invoked from items or read from scrolls cannot be augmented with any Warlock skills. Skills such as Concentration which have a constant effect always work while casting, invoking, or reading a spell.",

For example, a character with 75 Power Points can have any combination of skills and purchases totaling five. They could have five Overlay skills or one Overlay skill, two Speed Cast skills, and two Total Power skills. Another example, a character could have two Perfect Aim skills, two Speed Cast skills and one Total Power skill. The rest of the skills on this list do not count toward this multiple purchase limit.",

A player may have as many foci as they wish. Warlock focus, though used with magical skills, are not themselves magical and they do not detect as magical. They can be broken by any means, magical or normal. The can be identified with the Identify Component skill or by any Warlock touching one. The focus can be used a faith focus but cannot have any sorcery rituals cast upon them.",
      "The player can acquire a focus by making one themselves, purchasing one in-game from the Merchant’s Guild, or otherwise finding one in-game.",
      "To make one in-game, the character has to collect the required components in-game and perform a 20 minute ceremony. The character needs to know how to create the focus in-game. Once a character has learned 3 lesser Warlock skills they have the knowledge needed to create their own focus. Below is the list of components needed to create a focus.",

Red Casting Powder is measured in doses, each dose being approximately one thimble full. A single dose can be used to cast a single spell augmented by any number of Warlock skills.",
      "For example, Turlock lost his focus to a pick- pocket and as the thief tries to make his escape, Turlock decides to stop him, permanently. He has Red Casting Powder on him and casts his spell, “With Perfect Aim, Double Cast, Kill Spell”. The thief calls out the appropriate defenses and continues to run. Undaunted, Turlock tries again and casts another spell, “With Perfect Aim, Kill Spell”. This time the thief is done for and Turlock collects his stolen property. He has used a total of four of his Warlock skills to cast the first spell and two Warlock skills for the second, but still only used one dose of Red Casting Powder each time."

Armed with both defensive and offensive skills, a battle weathered Master Warrior can combine their experience, strength, skill and constitution to be a truly devastating force on the field of battle.

The character then purchases the Weapon Skill: One-Handed Blunt skill. They cannot use their Slays with a hammer for they do not have the minimum number of Proficiencies needed to use a Slay. The character learns a Master Proficiency skill and another Slay. They can use all three Slays with their axe, but none with their hammer – they still do not meet the minimum requirements for the Slay skill. Finally, the character learns one more Master Proficiency skill. Now they may use their three Slay skills with any One-Handed Edge or One- Handed Blunt weapon they pick up.",
      "A character must have the required number of Proficiency skills in the same weapon they wish to use the specialty skill in. For example, if a character has a Proficiency skill with One-Handed Edge and another one with One Handed Blunt, that character does not have the required prerequisite for the Slay skill.",
      "The prerequisite for Redirect Spell is the Channeling skill, which itself has a prerequisite of 30 Power Points. The character must have an additional 15 Power Points per Redirect Spell skill they wish to learn. So if a character wishes to learn four Redirect Spell skills, they would need to have a total of 60 Power Points, 30 Power Points for the first two skills, and fifteen more for each additional skill.",

In order for the skill to be expended for that Tag Cycle, the character must either strike their target or the target character uses an appropriate defense either magical or martial. The following skills follow this rule: Feat of Strength, Weapon Accuracy, Shatter Weapon, and Slay. Channeling works slightly differently and is discussed below.",

A character may find a teacher to teach them to channel other elemental schools of magic as well at no additional cost.",
      "In order to channel a spell, the character should recite the spell’s verbal then strike the target with their weapon. The character may cast the spell of the school they are channeling with a weapon in their hand. If the character takes damage while they are casting the spell, the spell is lost and the Power Points are expended. As with the normal rules of spell casting, the first thing the character’s weapon touches – even unintentionally such as a friend or a tree – will be affected by the spell. In other words, the character cannot choose to have the spell be released; the spell will automatically be released when it touches something. The targeted character cannot use a martial skill to parry the attack; a defense that stops spells – including the Redirect skill – must be used. Additionally, the character needs a weapon of quality to channel their spells. Normal weapons and temporarily alloyed weapons will not work. Any attempt to channel a spell using a normal weapon fails and the Power Points are expended. Should the character drop their weapon for any reason after they have already cast their spell, the spell is lost. The character must have a weapon in hand – not in their scabbard – to channel a spell or use the Redirect Spell skill.",
      "Only the elemental schools of magic may be channeled. When the character learns to channel that school they lose access to the non- damaging spells, except for any latent spell defenses. Additionally, the character loses the ability to throw spells from that school permanently. Following is a table that outlines what spells the character can cast for each school of magic.",

      "Only spells cast by the character can be channeled. Spells invoked from items or read from scrolls cannot be channeled, but they can be thrown, depending on the item. If a Channeler has a sword with an Invokable Fireball spell, they can invoke the spell and strike their target just like they are channeling. However if they have an item, either Castable or Invokable, that has an embedded Fireball spell in it, they could not channel that spell through their weapon using their skill. The same is true for spells read off scrolls; a character cannot channel a Fireball spell cast from a scroll.",

      "Master Thieves are skilled burglars, pickpockets, scouts and infiltrators. The varied skills of the Master Thief allow them to take advantage of almost any situation. No one is more adept at disarming traps and opening a lock than a Master Thief. Indeed, it is almost impossible to keep these skilled rogues out from where they are not wanted. While not good in a fight, they do possess the ability to silence a person and varied defensive skills to get themselves out of trouble.",
      "Master Thieves have different motivations. Some steal from the rich to give to the poor while others steal from anyone and give it all to themselves. Regardless of their intentions, Master Thieves oft find themselves in trouble with the law. With abilities like Pick Pockets and Speed Search they can quickly get what they are after; with the ability to dodge, deflect arrows, distract and escape they are able to get away with the goods. Even the most secure and well guarded treasure box is emptied flawlessly in mere seconds.",

An Assassin can be the good natured scout able to track down foes, or the typical killer for hire whose only allegiance is gold, or even the individual who kills for the thrill. Assassins have access to many skills, some of which are intended to deliver large amounts of damage or even kill in a single strike. They can learn to fight while blind and render a target helpless and paralyzed. Other skills allow the Assassin to strike without error from a distance or find the chink in armor. They have defensive skills as well, namely the legendary Dodge skill, which allows them to get out of most harm’s way. They can learn a repertoire of skills that assist them in applying their trade such as making poisons and learning how to take control of another’s will. The skills an Assassin can learn equip them to fulfill their clandestine operations.",
      "Regardless of mindset, the Assassin is always a dangerous adversary. While stealth and cunning are their greatest weapons, Assassins can evade most situations others cannot and are skilled enough to hold their own in combat – for a short time at least. While most Master Warriors can dispatch an Assassin easily in single fair combat, it is the Assassin who will be at your back before you are aware of them striking you down before you are able to raise a cry of warning.",

The High Lord is eternally opposed by the Dark Lord; where the High Lord seeks to protect, the Dark Lord harms, where the High Lord seeks to nurture, the Dark Lord corrupts and destroys. Thus their eternal fight - from the moment of their first awakening - rages across the world. This fight continues to this day, and will most likely continue to the end of time. In these modern days, the war is fought by their followers, and in the case of the High Lord, in the Cleric, Paladin, and White Sorcerer",

Clerics guide people who seek to follow the High Lord not just with teaching them, but with their needs, charitably giving of themselves for the sake of others. Clerics primarily assist others in the fight against those who seek to harm. Clerics are more often found amongst the people helping them, then they would be involved in a fight.",

Their task is to help and support those who fight on the side of Light with their potent magics, for not only are they able to cast all the neutral rituals, but the potent white rituals, some of which are only available to the White Sorcerer. The White Sorcerer’s role is similar to that of the Cleric, but where the Cleric teaches and guides, the White Sorcerer uses their gifts mainly to strengthen and help those who fight the good fight.",

Any race that has free will can become a Follower of the Light. Characters such as goblins, orcs, trolls and other creatures that do not have free will cannot follow any faith.

Indeed, each House of the Sun runs a soup kitchen providing food to those who cannot afford to feed themselves.",
