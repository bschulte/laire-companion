  "introduction": [
    "LAIRE is a live action game, and many of the things a player can do in the game are only limited by what they can physically perform. If a character wants to move silently through the woods, then the player does it; if a character wants to spot a bird two miles away, then the player looks; if a character wants to make a dramatic speech that will make people willing to fight and die for them, then the player says it.",
    "However, LAIRE is also a fantasy game, and it allows characters to perform tasks that people in the real world cannot. A skill is the game mechanic that allows a character to interact with the game world and perform things they would otherwise be unable to do. Players acquire skills for their characters by spending Build Points, and players get Build Points by adventuring. Build Points are sometimes referred to as just Build.",
    "In order for a character to be able to perform any of the skills listed in this rulebook, the player must purchase that skill. Just because a player can do something in “real life” does not mean their character can perform the skill in the game. For example, AJ may already be a locksmith in the real world, but any of his characters must have the Pick Locks skill before he can attempt to pick a lock in-game.",
    "A character gains skills and abilities by earning Build Points. By attending an event, players automatically earn Build Points for their character. In addition, a player may receive Roleplaying Chips (RC’s) for conspicuous roleplaying.",
    {
      "type": "header",
      "content": "Skill Costs"
    },
    "A player acquires skills for their character by spending Build Points. The cost of some skills depends on whether a character has a corresponding Skill List or not. There are three Basic Career Skill Lists and no Skill Lists for the Advanced Careers. A Skill List is not a skill by itself, but it makes the purchase of skills cost less. The purchase of a Skill List represents a general, overall knowledge of a field; it does not help a character perform any skills better, but it makes it easier to learn skills in that field.",
    "There are three Basic Career Skill Lists that cost Build Points to learn and gives a player’s character a cost reduction on those skills. They are: Warrior Basic Career Skill List, Mage Basic Career Skill List, and Rogue Basic Career Skill List. The rest of the lists in our game refer to groupings of skills that share a similar career. For example, the Master Warrior Skill List contains all the skills appropriate to Master Warriors. This does not imply that a Master Warrior would not have access to other skills in the game, just that these are the skills associated with the Master Warrior Advanced Career.",
    "There are two costs for almost every skill listed on the Basic Career Skill Lists. The first is the list price; this is the price a character pays when they have purchased the Skill List. The second higher cost is the non-list cost; this is the Build Point cost to buy the skill if a character has not already purchased the Skill List.",
    "If a character has already purchased skills in a list and then decides to purchase the list itself, the character will get back the extra Build spent on those skills.",
    "For example, Avirim Darkfire purchases the Polearm skill for 12 Build off list. Later, he learns the Weapons Skill List for 10 Build. He would get back 7 Build, the difference between the off list and on list cost of the Polearm skill.",
    "Note that this is the only way a character can reallocate Build already spent; a character cannot “give back” or unlearn a skill and get a Build Point refund. Additionally, the character must have the full 10 Build Points on their Character Card to learn the new Skill List.",
    "There is no penalty for knowing multiple Skill Lists, and a character may know as many as they wish and have the Build Points to spend."
  ],
  "basicCareerSkillLists": [
    "As stated a few times earlier in this chapter, there are three Basic Career Skill Lists which the player can choose for their new character. The player also has the option of just buying the skills off those lists and skills from the Miscellaneous Skill List. A character is not required to purchase one of these Skill Lists, but it is a smart choice. Many of the Advanced Careers require one of these lists as a prerequisite to learning skills from that career and it does save the character some Build Points. Similarly, there is nothing saying a player cannot learn all three lists if they wish, but it is also advantageous to the player’s character to focus their character on a specific career track. However the choice is ultimately up to the player.",
    "The three Basic Career Skill Lists each cost 10 Build Points and the Miscellaneous Skill List, like the Advanced Career Skill Lists, has no Build Point cost associated with it and all the skills on the list have only one cost. The three Basic Career Skill Lists are:",

    },
    "Those players who wish their characters to fight and have the skills and Body Points to make them good at it, should choose this Basic Career and the skills associated with this list. Warriors have a long tradition in fantasy fare to be the ones in the middle of the fighting, going toe to toe with all manner of monsters and villains. It is arguably the most physically demanding – on the player – career in the game.",
    "Many character archetypes fit in this Basic Career, the mercenary, bodyguard, soldier, and adventurer. Indeed, even footpads, highwaymen, and thugs can be made by purchasing this Skill List and later augmenting the character’s skills with a few Rogue skills.",
    "Warriors can learn any Weapon Skill, Shield Skill, or fighting style in the game. They can also learn a few basic, yet very effective, martial skills that will help them survive a fight.",
    "The only Advanced Career that is associated with this career is the Master Warrior. There are other Advanced Careers that the character may pursue that do not depend on a Basic Career for its basis, namely the Alchemist, Spell Singer, Druid, Follower of the Light or Servant of Darkness.",
    {
      "type": "header",
      "content": "Mage Basic Career"
    },
    "What is a fantasy game without the Mage? Most fantasy involves magical elements of some kind and there always seems to be a mage – for good or for ill – involved in the story. Mages in many fantasy stories and games go by various names: wizard, sorcerer, warlock, witch, spell caster, thaumaturge, etc. In our game, any character that casts magic is a Mage. Sorcerers and Warlocks are specialized mages and those names are reserved for those characters that pursue those Advanced Careers.",
    "There are numerous and varied character archetypes that fit in this Basic Career: hedge wizards, students of magic, combat mages, healers, etc. Magic in our game augments well with other careers to help to round out a character but it takes a committed amount of time and Build Points for a character to reach the higher ranks of magic; dabblers abound but masters are few.",
    "Mages can learn any School of Low Magic in our game and purchase their Power Points at a reduced cost. They can also easily learn to read magic but have a limited number of weapons to choose from.",
    "The Warlock and Sorcerer are the Advanced Careers that are associated with this list. The Alchemist and Spell Singer careers do not require the character to start out as this Basic Career. The character may also choose to follow one of the faiths and become a Druid, Follower of the Light or Servant of Darkness.",
    {
      "type": "header",
      "content": "Rogue Basic Career"
    },
    "Of all the career paths a player can choose for his character, none require the player to have as much out-of-game skill as the Rogue. These players must be able to do almost all the classic feats a fantasy Rogue can do. Even many of the skills a character will learn require the player to perform the task. Rogues in LAIRE are varied in how they apply their skills. They are the burglars, cutpurses, footpads, scouts, spies, sneaks, lookouts, treasure hunters, etc. of the fantasy genre.",
    "Rogues can learn to fight with many more weapon types than the Mage but not as many as the Warrior All of their fighting styles revolve around stealth, speed and dexterity. Additionally, the player will be able to choose from a few basic but useful skills to round out their character.",
    "When a character is ready to advance their career they will have two choices, the Master Thief and the Assassin. There are other Advanced Careers that the character may pursue that do not depend on a Basic Career for its basis, namely the Alchemist, Spell Singer, Druid, Follower of the Light or Servant of Darkness."

    "The Weapon Smith skill is purchased in ranks. Each rank allows the character to make more complicated weapons. Additionally, the higher ranks of the Weapon Smith skill allow the character to create weapons of quality. All weapons require stock material which is purchasable in-game from the Armory or out-of-game from the Treasure Manager.",
    "A character can create any number of normal weapons they wish in between Events. They need to pay the production cost for the raw materials to the Treasure Manager and receives the appropriate weapon card. If a character wishes to make a weapon during an Event, they must spend the indicated time in-game. All special weapons must be made in-game.",
    "In addition to the stock materials, the character also needs access to a forge. A character can find a forge in the City of Avalon in the Armory. The player needs to find out in-game what their character needs to do to gain access to the forges in the armory.",
    "The production times listed in the following table indicates how much time the character must spend making the listed weapons. All times, after the initial base crafting times, are cumulative. Therefore, if a character wanted to make a permanently silvered, unshatterable long sword with a +1 Damage Bonus, they would need to spend 1 hour and 30 minutes at a forge to complete the work. The time spent must be uninterrupted, but does not require concentration to complete. If the character is forced to stop their work, the task fails and the stock materials lost. The character may talk to other characters or move around the forge performing the forging. They may cast spells, fish an item out of a pouch, or perform other simple tasks, but not engage in combat for more than 30 seconds or move more than 20 feet from the forge.”",
    "The costs of the stock materials must be found out in-game. With the exception of Mithril weapons, any broken weapon can be re-forged if the pieces are present. The base cost needs to be paid again and the time spent forging the weapon. Weapons destroyed with the Shatter spell, Blast spell and Shatter Weapon skill render the weapon into pieces too small to reasonably find or re-forge. Read the descriptions below for more information on re-forging those types of weapons.",
    "Below is an explanation of the various special weapons and crafting skills listed in the table. All crafting must be done at the time the weapon is made with the exception of Metal Coatings, which is done after the weapon is constructed. Any combination of these crafting skills is possible, though some like Dwarven Crafting a Mithril weapon does not make sense.",
    "Normal Weapons are common fare of weapons most characters have. They are the norm against which all others are compared. A broken weapon can be re-forged with no additional materials cost.",
    "Cold Forging refers to a special process of making a weapon without the aid of fire. Without the tempering of the metal it is weaker and does not hold an edge well, therefore it suffers a -1 Damage Bonus. These weapons have a special effect on some characters, which the player must find out in-game. A Cold Forged Shield has no special qualities. A broken Cold Forged weapon can be re-forged with no additional materials cost. Cold Forging alone does not make a weapon an item of quality.",
    "Metal Coatings allow a weapon to swing for that metal for 12 months – not Events – after its making. Eventually this coating will wear off and in 12 months – not Events – the weapon will be normal again. The metal to coat the weapon with must be available and is part of the stock material cost. Coated weapons are still considered normal, not a weapon of quality. Copper, Silver and Gold coatings are the most common. A weapon with a Metal Coating can be re- forged if broken but without the coating. Mithril and Adamantite can never be coated with another metal nor can they be used to coat a weapon.",
    "A Dissection Knife is constructed out-of-game as an edged throwing weapon, however, it can never be used in combat. Dissection knives are required to use the Dissection skill. They can be combined with other crafting skills, such as Elven and Dwarven crafting, and made of any metal.",
    "Wire Creation is the ability to make wire from coins or stock. Each coin can make a 12 inch long piece of wire. The appropriate metal must be available to make the wire.",
    "Venom Weapons are daggers or swords that have a special chamber in the pommel of the weapon that allows the character to load a contact alchemical item into the blade. Normally when a blade is coated with a contact alchemical item the next swing uses it up. The character can choose when to coat their weapon before they swing with the alchemical item, they suffix their damage with “Poison” when they swing. Only one dose of the alchemical item can be loaded at a time. Venom Weapons are far too intricate to re-forge and must be completely remade. Venom weapons are not marked in any special way and appear as normal weapons unless inspected closely.",
    "Some rituals require a weapon or shield to be Enchantment Quality in order to hold the enchantment; this crafting creates such a weapon. This crafting does not change the properties of the weapon. The special property of the Enchantment Quality is lost if the weapon is broken and only the base normal weapon can be re-forged.",
    "A weapon can be made Permanently Alloyed with Copper, Silver, or Gold with this crafting. The weapon must be created from scratch; an existing weapon cannot be Permanently Alloyed after its creation. This effect lasts until the weapon is destroyed. These weapons can be re-forged with no additional material cost.",
    "A weapon smith can craft Boxes out of metal or wood of a maximum of 10 cubic feet. While not useful in and of itself, when combined with Dwarven Crafting and Dwarven Crafted Locks, characters have a safe place to keep their in-game belongings.",
    "Bone Crafting allows the character to make a weapon out of the bones of a mystical creature that has Damage Resistance: Silver or better. The bone weapon will always suffer a -1 Damage Bonus penalty and can never, ever be combined with any other crafting skill except Enchantment Quality.",
    "Unshatterable or Dwarven Crafted weapons and shields cannot be broken. They are not affected by the Shatter or Blast spells or the Shatter Weapon skill. They cannot be broken with any Strength Bonus. This does not mean they are indestructible. Anything that would melt a normal weapon will destroy an Unshatterable weapon. These weapons cannot ever be re-forged once destroyed.",
    "Elven Crafting give a weapon a +1 Damage Bonus. This crafting can be combined with any other crafting including Mithril weapons. Once broken, the weapon can be re-forged but will not retain its Damage Bonus and the base cost must be repaid to regain the bonus. Elven Crafting a shield gives no additional bonus.",
    "Weapons and shields can be forged with Mithril. These Mithril Forged weapons and shields are indestructible and nothing short of an Eldritch attack will harm these weapons and shields. Mithril ore is mined like any other ore and smelted into bars; however unlike mundane metals, once forged into something, Mithril can never be re-forged. There are different types of Mithril – normal Mithril, Starfire Mithril, Moonfire Mithril, and Sunfire Mithril. Under starlight, Starfire Mithril gains a +1 Damage Bonus and is magical, Moonfire gains the same properties under moon light and Sunfire gains the same bonuses under sunlight. Mithril Forged weapons that have a wooden haft such as axes, hammers and polearms are assumed to have Unshatterable hafts and therefore the entire weapon is Unshatterable, this adds no extra time or cost and is assumed to be calculated in already."

Additionally the character can make a piece of leather or metal armor worth up to 6 Armor Points per purchase of the skill. When creating a new piece of armor the character must have the appropriate amount of stock material. This material is purchasable in-game from the Armory Guild or out-of-game from the Treasure Manager.",

If the character wishes to make the armor in-game they must spend the indicated time roleplaying the creation of the armor. All special armor types must be made in-game.",
    "The chart below indicates the sectional armor pieces a character can make and the times associated with its creation. Additionally, there is a Base Time needed to make any set of armor, whether it is one piece or a whole suit. These times are cumulative, so if the character wishes to make a piece of light plate chest armor (16 minutes) with shoulders (4 minutes) and sleeves (4 minutes) that covers the groin and thighs (8 minutes), the total time would be 72 minutes. The time spent must be uninterrupted, but does not require concentration to complete. If the character is forced to stop their work, the task fails and the stock materials lost. The character may talk to other characters or move around the forge performing the forging. They may cast spells, fish an item out of a pouch, or perform other simple tasks, but not engage in combat for more than 30 seconds or move more than 20 feet from the forge.",

Four purchases of the Armor Smith skill is needed for Eleven Crafting, Dwarven Crafting, Bone Crafting, and Enchantment Quality. Five purchases of the Armor Armor skill is needed for Mithril Crafting.",

For example, it would normally take the character 42 minutes to make a chain mail shirt that covers the torso and shoulders. If it was to be made Dwarven Crafted, it would take the character 63 minutes. If it was Elven and Dwarven Crafted, the total time would be 84 minutes.",
    "There is little use in-game to make a shield using Cold Forging. This crafting alone does not make a shield an item of quality and therefore cannot be used to stop spells.",
    "Elven Crafting a suit of armor increases the amount of Base Armor Points, the Armor Points without the Real Bonus, by 25%.",

This increases the Base Armor Points by 50%, the armor degrades after taking damage by 2 Armor Points instead of the normal 3 Armor Points, and makes the armor indestructible and nothing short of an Eldritch attack will destroy the armor. However, this does not mean the armor cannot be damaged during a fight. The same rules apply for Mithril armor, but the suit itself cannot be destroyed. Mithril ore is mined like any other ore and smelted into bars; however unlike mundane metals, once forged into something, Mithril can never be re-forged.
